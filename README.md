## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I can say that i"m really proud of how it turned out to be. I managed to learn that creating a sketch design first in Figma really helps me to structure my HTML and also how i style them.

Also i'm trying to force myself using a modular SCSS by secluding mixins, breakpoints, and config stuff inside a folder and use it on the main `style.scss` file. Its still not the best practices structure but at least i'm getting there! :sweat_smile:

### Continued development

- Adding more accessibility.
- Creating this with only CSS.
- Creating this same website but with React! :v:

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This really helped me.
